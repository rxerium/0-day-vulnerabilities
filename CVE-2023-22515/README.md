# # CVE-2023-22515

## Details

Atlassian has been made aware of an issue reported by a handful of customers where external attackers may have exploited a previously unknown vulnerability in publicly accessible Confluence Data Center and Server instances to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and access Confluence instances.

## Detection

Atlassian have published a list of vulnerable versions on their advisory page [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/cve-2023-22515-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-confluence-data-center-and-server-1295682276.html).

I have created a [Nuclei template](https://github.com/rxerium/0-days/blob/main/CVE-2023-22515/template.yaml) to scan for this vulnerablity at scale. Do note this is a passive template which detects the version of the remote confluence server. If you are looking for a more intrusive template, that can be found [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/http/cves/2023/CVE-2023-22515.yaml)

 It goes without saying, **only run this on infrastructure you own or have permission to scan.**

### Running the detection template

In order to run the dection template you will need to install [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei), once installed clone my [Nuclei template](https://github.com/rxerium/0-days/blob/main/CVE-2023-20198/template.yaml) then run the following command in your terminal:

```
nuclei -u template.yaml -u <IP/FQDN> -stats
```

If vulnerable it will output the result in your terminal. If you are wanting to run this through a set of hosts replace the `-u` flag with `-l` like so:

```
nuclei -u template.yaml -l input.txt -stats
```

The input.txt file must contain 1 host per line. 

## Mitigation Measures

Atlassian recommends that you upgrade each of your affected installations to one of the listed fixed versions (or any later version) below:

- 8.3.3 or later
- 8.4.3 or later
- 8.5.2 (Long Term Support release) or later
