# CVE-2023-20198

## Details

Cisco has identified active exploitation of a previously unknown vulnerability in the Web User Interface (Web UI) feature of Cisco IOS XE software (CVE-2023-20198) when exposed to the internet or untrusted networks. 

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create an account on the affected device with privilege level 15 access, effectively granting them full control of the compromised device and allowing possible subsequent unauthorized activity.

## Detection

Cisco have advised running the following POST request to verify the presence of the implant on any affected device:
```
curl -k -X POST "https[:]//DEVICEIP/webui/logoutconfirm.html?logon_hash=1"
```

If it returns a hex value then it is vulnerable to the vulnerablity CVE-2023-20198. I have created a [Nuclei template](https://github.com/rxerium/0-days/blob/main/CVE-2023-20198/template.yaml) to scan for this vulnerablity at scale. It goes without saying, only run this on infrastructure you own or have permission to scan. 

### Running the detection template

In order to run the dection template you will need to install [Nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei), once installed clone my [Nuclei template](https://github.com/rxerium/0-days/blob/main/CVE-2023-20198/template.yaml) then run the following command in your terminal:

```
nuclei -u template.yaml -u <IP/FQDN> -stats
```

If vulnerable it will output the result in your terminal. If you are wanting to run this through a set of hosts replace the `-u` flag with `-l` like so:

```
nuclei -u template.yaml -l input.txt -stats
```

The input.txt file must contain 1 host per line. 

## Mitigation Measures

Cisco have advised admins to disable the HTTP server feature on internet-facing systems, which would remove the attack vector and block incoming attacks. To do so admins will need to run either one of the following commands in global configuration mode:

```
no ip http server
```
OR
```
no ip http secure-server
```
